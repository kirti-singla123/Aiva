# 🤖 AIVA – Local AI Virtual Assistant

**AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Assistant)** is a locally running AI chatbot designed to demonstrate how modern **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be integrated into a full-stack web application.

The project combines a **React-based chat interface**, a **Django backend**, and a **local AI model powered by Ollama** to allow users to interact with an AI assistant directly from their system.

Unlike cloud-based AI tools, AIVA runs **entirely on a local environment**, making it suitable for experimentation, learning, and private AI deployments.
